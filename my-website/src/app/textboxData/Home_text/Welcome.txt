Welcome to my Personal Website!
My name is Ayden Boyko.
ANIMATIONS ON TEXT BOXES, SLIDE IN FROM THE SIDE UPON PAGE LOADING,
ANIMATION ON PAGE CHANGE, CUBE EXPANDS ON HOVER,
ON CLICK IT CONTRACTS AND TINY BLACK OR dark:WHITE SQUARE PARTICLES EMINATE WHEN SQUARE CRUNCHES DOWN,
WHEN PARTICLES ARE EMIANTED TEXT BOXES SLIDE OFF SCREEN, LEAVING PARTICLES AS WELL

might have to turn taskbar buttons into seperate components like textbox, 
that way the animations can be rendered clientside when button is clicked
