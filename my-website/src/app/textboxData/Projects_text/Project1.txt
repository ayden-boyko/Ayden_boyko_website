This Project was my first introduction to frontend development, and I was hooked!
Using React components I created a timer that was able to:
log times,
edit times logged,
change the name of the user who was using the timer (this will change the name displayed when time is logged), 
It is important to note that this project has no backend, therefore I only allowed one user to be made.
