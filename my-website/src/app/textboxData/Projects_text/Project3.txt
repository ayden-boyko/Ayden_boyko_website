This project is a mock rideshare backend. The Database I used was Postgresql. The Api conforms to the REST architectural style. The api allows all information related to rider or driver to be accessed. The user can also view the reciepts for all their rides. The Database allows full functionality for a ridesharing app, this includes creating/deleting accounts, finding rides, starting rides, carpooling, leaving reviews for riders and drivers and also responding to said reviews.
